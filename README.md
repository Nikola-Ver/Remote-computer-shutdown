The program can remotely shutdown your computer from any device (if the device and the computer are on the same network)

## Overview

</p>

### Full screen mode

- To enter full screen mode, you need to hold 3 fingers on the screen

### Running the program

- To start the program, you need to go to the "start_program" folder, after which you need to run the "start" ("start.bat") or "hiddenStart" ("hiddenStart.vbs") file. The first file runs the program in the console, after which the program can be closed if desired, and the second file runs the program in the background. To close a program in the background, you will need to find it in the task manager and close it yourself

- To find out the address to which you need to go, run "getAddress" ("getAddress.bat"), which is located in the "get_address" folder. Then go from any device to the specified address, for example "http://192.168.100.4:3000/"
